TOOLS	:	we have used news ,  joke and weather APIs and python programming language to build this project .



USES :You can get the current top news in BBC , you can get a funny joke (not actually) and the current weather of any city in the world .



DIFFICULTIES : At the begining we messed up with the api and finnaly found out these .Especially  we can't joke api which gives a joke , all the joke api gives a sentence and names it as joke . After going  through lot of dippression in joke api we finnally finished the project . But not actually finished , we have planned to create a web app but due to lack of time we finished using python .
									
	

FURTHER  PLANS	: To create a web version of it .




DISCLIMERS:	This documentation may (not compulsarily) have some spelling mistakes so forgive us for that .For non-coders API means 
API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each                            other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.
The joke generated by the joke generator might not look like a joke but it is actally a joke please beleive me .
